Fiza Khan — Personal Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It showcases my skills, projects, and background as a Frontend Developer and BS Computer Science student at COMSATS University.

The portfolio features a clean, responsive layout with smooth scrolling and an elegant UI — designed to highlight my creativity, technical skills, and passion for web development.# My-own-Portflio
